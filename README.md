Basic Python Keylogger (Client and Server Sides)

Firstly, run the server side script. Once active, the client side can then be used to connect and capture keystrokes.

-- Server Side --

- Works on multiple devices (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).
- Captures all incoming keystrokes.
- Stored in KeyLog.txt file in the same directory as server-side is running.
- Shows connected IP address.

-- Client Side -- 

- Works on multiple devices (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).
- Establishes connection with server.
- Once connections established, all key strokes are collected and stored on the server-side.
- Before using/sending out client side, change the server IP address to your respective IP to establish connection.
